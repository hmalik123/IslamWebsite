                <p>
                  In Islamic theology, Islam is viewed as the restoration of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Abraham. 
                  Muslims believe that Judaism and Christianity originated from divine revelations but that their scriptures were 
                  altered over time, while the Quran remains preserved in its original form. The Prophet Muhammad is considered the 
                  final messenger in a long line of prophets that includes prominent figures from Jewish and Christian traditions.
